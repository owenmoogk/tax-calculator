# DISCLAIMER: 
	
Offsetting capital gains with capital losses is a good way to reduce the tax burden on inheritants, however this calculator assumes you do the following instantaniously:
	- Remove from the market to realize gains
	- Reinvest (probably into the same stocks / bonds)
	
It is important to note that this might not be perfectly feasable, and in the case of capital losses, is ILLEGAL. You have to wait 30 days before re-purchasing an investment you sold for a loss (otherwise it is called superficial loss, CRA doesn't like that very much).

Unless your investments are quite volatile, this is probably fine and doesn't impact the calculations much (also, hopefully you don't have too many losses :P).
